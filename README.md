### Why? The Declaration of Independence | Craig L Claybrook ###
"Periodically, Mr. Claybrook is asked, “Why did you memorize The Declaration of Independence?” In mid-June of 2016, he was between jobs and sitting in a donut shop when I wondered, “What can I do that no one else is doing or can do?” Five seconds later it hit him: “I can memorize!” Then it hit me again, “I can memorize The Declaration of Independence. If I can memorize three wedding ceremonies, containing twelve pages of script, then, surely, I can memorize the Declaration.” … Even though the “difficulty factor” superseded the wedding ceremonies, he was able to memorize the Declaration in 100 days.
 
When responding to the “why” question, he sometimes borrows from Charles Krauthammer who famously said, “So I can get filthy rich and pay off my gambling debts.” Actually, he just felt moved of God to do this but really did not know “why.” Eventually, he stumbled into the fact that it contains four references to God. He then realized that these four references are found in the first two sentences and last two sentences, effectively forming bookends around the Declaration. He surmised that this was the Founders’ way of “shouting from the rooftops” that God is in The Declaration of Independence and God is in the founding of this country. Upon grasping this, he felt as if he had entered into a higher dimension, that he was on sacred ground, that he was dealing with “the conscience of our nation.”   
 
In addition, it struck him that the Declaration is seldom, if ever, read on Fourth of July, that our nation “oohs and awes” fireworks but ignores the Declaration. To him, it seems that our nation has simply relegated the DOI to the “ash heap of history.” Considering that historians call it “one of the two most important documents in human history, second only to the Bible,” this seems especially tragic. (The other document is the U.S. Constitution.) Mr. Claybrook views those four references to God as “the pinnacle of little-known facts.” More importantly, these references pinpoint the apex of our nation’s foundational underpinnings—God Himself."
